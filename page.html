			<h2> Thank Your For Today, </h2>
				<p> thank you for coming to see me, <br />
				 even though it was out of your way, <br />
				 even after a long day's of hard work <br />
				 that won't go unnotice <br />
				 thank you for coming to see me </p> 

				 <p> thank you for letting me hold your hand, <br />
				 publicly at the mall, <br />
				 thank you for introducing me as your boyfriend to your friend, <br />
				 even though you didn't have to. </p>

				 <p> thank you for working out with me, <br />
				 or more like, thank for your letting me workout with you. <br />
				 As you put it, you look like you were training me. <br />
				 thank you for enduring with me. </p>

				 <p>Thank you for tonight, <br />
				 thank you for staying so late, <br />
				 even though its a weekday, <br />
				 and you have work the next morning.</p> 


				 <p> thank you driving home safe, <br />
				 so I can be on the phone with you later that night. <br />
				 Thank you for accepting my heart, <br />
				 thank you for taking home my heart to you, <br />
				 my bestfriend, my lifelong dream, my partner, <br />
				 thank you for being a part of my life and hopefully through the rest of my life, <br />
				 for better or for worse, <br />
				 thank you </p>
